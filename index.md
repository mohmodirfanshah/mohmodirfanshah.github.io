Mohmod Irfan Shah is a student of Life, for Life who is pursuing B.E Civil Engineering from SSM College of Engineering, Parihaspora Pattan. He has been fond of writing since childhood. He is an Author, Blogger, Columnist, poet and co-author of three anthologies. After more than a year of penning articles for local daily newspapers of Jammu and Kashmir, Mohmod Irfan Shah has acquired a particularly  declarative  voice that comes through  his most recent collection of articles exploring social and mental trauma in today's era. He is ambitious, adventurous, assiduous, animated, and an alliteration advocate. 

## A Cinephile and A Melomaniac
Irfan will choose to watch a movie or read, over everything. From Hollywood to Iranian Cinema, silent era to CGI, shorts to 6 hour longs, Western to Thriller, low budget to big budget, he loves them all. No movie is good or bad, it’s just a matter of taste!

Irfan has two strict rules, “Whoever says that The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest movie of all time, he doesn’t talk movies with them.” The other rule, he doesn’t talk about it.

To have a good taste in music is a blessing. It depends on his mood what song he will listen to. It can be Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Bob Dylan, Pt Ravi Shankar, Led Zeppelin, Ustadh Bismillah Khan, Tupac Shakur, Mohsen Namjoo, Iqbal Bano and likes. He usually listens to Urdu, Persian, English, Hindi, Kashmiri songs.

## My Book - Surviving the Apocalyptic Society

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uU6ead-2L._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I recently authored a book "Surviving the Apocalyptic Society" which was officially released on 26th of August on Amazon, Kindle, Flipkart and Notion Press. This book presents a sophisticated response to the question of what constitutes social problems and mental health deterioration, with thirteen different entries, giving a range of perspectives on the central problem issues of our generation. It also includes my personal experience and how I managed my stressful life in today's society. It also provides valuable suggestions for social issues and mental health. The topics cover areas of concern connected with physical and mental health, poverty, education, violence and crime, family and social relationships, etc. Every age group from different backgrounds will find this book helpful, whether casual readers or students. My experiences with dating, breakups, literary life, therapists, the world, the arts, family, and social media are all explored in this book. My keen perceptions of the human experience and brilliant clarity will give you a vision of what the current generation is going through, physically, virtually, verbally, socially and mentally.
