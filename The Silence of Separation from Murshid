#The Silence of Separation from Murshid

When I walk into the memories of our shared existence,
I see your soul woven with the grace but flaws by chance.
Unseen by your eyes, as you've become the ink to my pen,
It's the romance of words on the pages every now and then.

Yet here, where in my kingdom, our laughter echoed,
Is where I meet with mocking disbelief of our shadows.
I undoubtedly reflect the love which remained unsold,
For in human instinct, they doubt the purity we hold.

In an era, where lust befouls the separation of beloved's pain,
Ustaad Nusrat's name bears the weight of being insane,
Misjudged, as if they can measure the depth of his agony,
I, no Nusrat or Jaun Elia, but murshid, as you called me.

The world we are a part of is as cruel as our separation,
Drives me closer to the madness of sensation.
Yet they don't know my Laila, who is tired of my absence, 
Who is ready to wither in the longing of my presence.

Tell them if my murshid succumbs to the madness,
I am the Laila, loyal to him in the devotion of sadness.
Waiting, craving, yearning, with the fear of fading,
In the deeply affecting silence of this moment of separating.
